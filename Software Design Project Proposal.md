## Identifying and Defining
### Identifying a Need
**Need:** To sharpen and challenge the player's problem-solving abilities and platforming skills.

**Problem Statement:** Many video games require little thinking and problem-solving. A puzzle-platformer game is the perfect game to enchance the player's problem-solving and thinking skills.

**Skill Development:** To develop the skills in Unity required to create the game, I will use my knowledge gained from my previous Unity game, and I can do research for any additional functionalities that my game may require.

### Requirements Outline

**Inputs:** User inputs will include WASD or arrow keys for movement, and spacebar for jumping. It will also include a key for the special action of switching positions with the box.

**Processing:** The game will check for any collisions, calculate the player's position, and check if the player is at the end of the level.

**Outputs:** The game will update the position of the player, and will go to the next level if the player is at the end of the level.

**Transmission:** 

**Storage:** The game will store which levels have been completed.
